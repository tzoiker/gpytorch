    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll give a brief tutorial on how to use Lanczos Variance Estimates (LOVE) to achieve fast predictive distributions as described in this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06058. To see LOVE in use with exact GPs, see `fast_variances_exact_(LOVE).ipynb`. For a tutorial on using the fast sampling mechanism described in the paper, see `fast_sampling_ski_(LOVE).ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "LOVE is an algorithm for approximating the predictive covariances of a Gaussian process in constant time after linear time precomputation. In this notebook, we will train a deep kernel learning model with SKI on one of the UCI datasets used in the paper, and then compare the time required to make predictions with each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: The timing results reported in the paper compare the time required to compute (co)variances __only__. Because excluding the mean computations from the timing results requires hacking the internals of GPyTorch, the timing results presented in this notebook include the time required to compute predictive means, which are not accelerated by LOVE. Nevertheless, as we will see, LOVE achieves impressive speed-ups."
